# Snowbridge Integration Guides

Hey there! Welcome to our technical docs. :)

### Snowbridge V2

Snowbridge V2 was just released, so if you are doing a new integration, we'd recommend you start with our V2 docs:

* [V2 SDK (Beta)](snowbridge-v2/typescript-sdk/)
* [V2 Parachain Integration](snowbridge-v2/parachain-integration.md)

### Snowbridge V1

We will keep Snowbridge V1 live until all our partners have moved their integration to use V2. Until then, here are our V1 docs:

* [V1 SDK](snowbridge-v1/typescript-sdk.md)
* [V1 Parachain Integration](snowbridge-v1/parachain-integration.md)

### Support

To get in touch, please log an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge/issues). We will be in touch to set up a Telegram group, if necessary.
