# Snowbridge V1

Snowbridge V2 has been released and is the preferred integration to Snowbridge. However, Snowbridge V1 will be supported until all of our partners have integrated with V2.

#### Integration Types

To integrate with Snowbridge V1, dApps or wallets can use our TypeScript SDK. Parachains who want to integrate directly with our bridge, should follow the V1 parachain integration guide.

* [V1 SDK](typescript-sdk.md)
* [V1 Parachain Integration](parachain-integration.md)
