# Snowbridge V2

## V2 features

Snowbridge V2 improves on Snowbridge V1, by adding new features such as contract execution in both directions of the bridge. This introduces a powerful composing engine that opens up new use cases for the bridge, such as integration with Ethereum L2.

Snowbridge V2 also significantly lowers fee, especially in the Polkadot -> Ethereum direction.

#### Integration Types

To integrate with Snowbridge V2, dApps or wallets can use our TypeScript SDK. Parachains who want to integrate directly with our bridge, should follow the V2 parachain integration guide.

* [V2 SDK (BETA)](typescript-sdk/)
